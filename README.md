Project Euler in Go
===================

I've decided to kill two birds with one stone (in my spare time) and have fun solving some problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) and learn Go at the same time. This should be a win-win situation :-)

As I learn more, I hope the solutions become more idiomatic. Use at your own risk!
